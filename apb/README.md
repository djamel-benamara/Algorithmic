Students apply to universities. Universities accept the students they like the most. The goal is to satisfy both students and universities.

Students must have the university they want the most every time this university want them too.

A university must have the students it want the most every time these students want this university more than the others OR the universities they want more rejected them.

The satisfaction rate of the student is shown in the end.

You can change the number of students and universities and also the number of places for each university and uncomment the line in the main to see clearly the details of the algorithm.
